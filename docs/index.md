# ShapeReality Manual

Welcome to the Manual for ShapeReality, an experimental design application for **Meta Quest 2** and **Meta Quest Pro**, allowing you to import 3D models and place them in AR, in real-world scale. 

The app features an intuitive user interface and robust interaction model for moving, rotating and scaling objects from a distance, at their real world scale. 

!!!note
    The application is still in active development and features are subject to change. 

## How to use

Select your dominant hand in the Settings panel. By default this is set to `right handed`.

Your dominant hand controller has a **ray**, and a **cursor** at the end of that ray. With it, you can **point**, **click** and **drag** UI elements or objects in the scene.

### Clicking and dragging
Clicking works by pressing either the trigger, or the two buttons located on the top of the controller (either A/B or X/Y, depending on whether you're left or right handed). 

Dragging works by clicking, and moving your cursor from the original click position.
