# About ShapeReality

ShapeReality was created with the goal of being able to design in augmented reality, in real-world 1:1 scale using the newest AR and VR hardware such as the Meta Quest Pro. 

The application has been created by Arjo Nagelhout and Daniel Chou Rainho at [Innovation Space](https://www.tue.nl/en/education/tue-innovation-space) at the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/) in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, and is currently in active development. The project was started in September 2022. 

But, why create an augmented reality design application?

## The potential of augmented reality

Augmented reality, virtual reality, games and computer generated imagery and visual effects (CGI and VFX) are techniques and mediums that are unprecedented in their ability to communicate ideas with others. Where a pictures says more than a thousand words, these techniques and mediums go an entire step further by making people able to experience these ideas. You don't have to imagine or extrapolate, because it feels like it's *really there*. 

We believe that for this reason, augmented reality could be an invaluable tool in the tool belt of architects, designers and artists. 

Imagine walking to that one overcrowded six lanes-wide street in your city. The one with exhaust fumes trapped between the buildings, that was once the main road that everyone walked on before the ☆automobile☆ took over. Imagine standing there, and showing municipalities, friends and residents of that neighbourhoods the difference it would make if it was a walkable, lush green street. With a flick of a switch you see and *experience* what that would be like. 

We get used to our surroundings, but augmented reality gives us the ability to challenge it. To change our cities for the better.[^1]

## Vision for a usable augmented reality design application

In addition to this motivation, we aim to set a new standard for what a good user interface and user experience for augmented reality head-mounted devices looks and *feels* like. 

Many software applications for AR and VR have confusing interfaces, while not providing any speed benefits after learning "their way of doing things". Many interfaces are bare-bones because of a lack of a good UI framework. With additional features only further complicating the interface by adding yet another button mapping to an already overcrowded controller. 

We try to stay close to how traditional software applications work, with **pointing**, **clicking** and **dragging** to select and move objects, the concept of **tools** to move, rotate, scale objects and draw shapes, and **panels** that contain settings, documents, assets or colors. 

For anyone familiar with desktop software applications such as Adobe Illustrator, Unity or Blender, there should only be a small learning curve. See the section on the [User Interface](../sections/user-interface.md) for a quick rundown on how the interface works.
