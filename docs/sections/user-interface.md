# User interface


## How to use

Select your dominant hand in the Settings panel. By default this is set to `right handed`.

Your dominant hand controller has a **ray**, and a **cursor** at the end of that ray. With it, you can **point**, **click** and **drag** UI elements or objects in the scene.

### Clicking and dragging
Clicking works by pressing either the trigger, or the two buttons located on the top of the controller (either A/B or X/Y, depending on whether you're left or right handed). 

Dragging works by clicking, and moving your cursor from the original click position.
